# Biometric-Authentication
final year project
The core of this study is to secure the userâ€™s data in an effective manner. Security measures 
such as encryption of the biometric data and the use of secure communication protocols are 
necessary to ensure the system is secure and protects user privacy. A proposed system for 
authentication using both iris and fingerprint biometrics involves enrolling the user's biometric 
data and using it to verify their identity during the authentication process. When a user attempts 
to access a secure system or physical space, they are prompted to present their iris and 
fingerprint for authentication. The system captures the biometric data and compares it to the 
stored data on file for that user. If both the iris and fingerprint data match, along with the onetime password generated in the authentication process the user is granted access.
